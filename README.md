# bamToBigWig
Directly create a bigwig file with signal derived from a sorted and indexed bam file.

This script uses pysam to read the input bam file, filters and shifts the reads,
and then computes the signal with single base resolution and directly outputs
a wiggle file to a wigToBigWig process that runs in the background.
